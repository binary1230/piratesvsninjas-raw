Random notes for those looking at the source code for the first time.

The game engine parses XML files to figure out what its supposed to
load for each level.

Why XML?  Isn't that nasty, hard, wasteful, etc?

It's easy though.  Easy as hell and easy to detect errors.
Seriously, XML parsing isn't that hard.  Say this XML file represents
an EGG.  Just a regular old chicken egg.  Maybe it looks like this:

<eggshell>
	<inner color="yellow" status="gross">
	
		42 IS A GOOD NUMBER

		<definitelyDead />
	</inner>
</eggshell>

Here's some code that we could use to parse it:

// look for the <eggshell> tag
XMLNode xEgg = XMLNode::openFileHelper("egg.xml", "eggshell");

// get the <inner> tag
XMLNode xInner = xEgg.getChildNode("inner");

// get the text of the <inner> tag (in this case it's "42 IS A GOOD NUMBER")
char* str = xInner.getText();

// get the "color" attribute from <inner> (in our case it's "gross")
char* str = xInner.getAttribute("color");

There's a few more things you can do with the xml library we use (xmlParser)
but those are a few good examples.
