This folder contains a list of the functions which PVN uses right now
for Allegro.

In order to make a dreamcast port work better, I am thinking we may do
one of a few things:

1) Stop using allegro, use SDL
 - Allegro is VERY fast though on systems with no HW acceleration
 - Is the SDL speed of non-cool computers (e.g. my 600mhz Laptop)
   comparable to that of allegro?  Also, 640x480 is the target resolution.
 
2) Build some kind of 'graphics rendering library' that can use SDL and alleg
 - Could choose one or the other
 - Bugs harder to find, not exactly the same behavior on each
 
3) Write an allegro wrapper for dreamcast
 - Implement the functions seen in func_conflicts.txt for the DC
 - Probbaly harder than it looks...
