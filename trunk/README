HACKING ON THE GAME
-------------------

Try messing with stuff in data/
The entire game is controlled via a series of XML files.

The game initial reads data/default.xml and includes the other XML files.

You can customize pretty much everything by modifying things in those XML
files.

There's not really an documentation yet for modders because at this point
things are changing quite rapidly in the engine.  However, if you'd
like some, feel free to send an angry email to binary1230 at yahoo d0t com,
saying something like "MORON! Write some docs! Clean your code up!"

NOTE: You MUST have the following at the top of EVERY XML FILE:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>

Happy hacking! Have fun!
