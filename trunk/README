HACKING ON THE GAME
-------------------

Try messing with stuff in data/
The entire game is controlled via a series of XML files.

The game initial reads data/default.xml and includes the other XML files.

You can customize pretty much everything by modifying things in those XML
files.

Happy hacking! Have fun!
