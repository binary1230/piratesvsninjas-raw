Currently you can build for windows, linux, or mac
You can also build the windows packages under linux (and probably mac)

OUT OF DATE, CHECK THE WIKI

----------------------
Dependencies
----------------------
- libpng
- libvorbis
- zlib
- allegro

---------------------------
To Build from Subversion
---------------------------
run ./regen.sh FIRST. then do your ./configure and make

--------------------
LINUX BUILD (normal)
--------------------
untar everything somewhere (say ~/ninjas)

 cd ~/ninjas
 make
 ./ninjas

---------------------------------------------------
WINDOWS BUILD (cross-compile)
do this under linux to produce a windows .exe file
setting up allegro is tricky this way.
---------------------------------------------------
untar everything somewhere (say ~/ninjas)

 cd ~/ninjas/src
 [edit Makefile.mgw for your paths]
 make -f Makefile.mgw
 cd ..
 [copy data/, ninjas.exe, and alleg40.dll for distribution]

----------------------------------------------
WINDOWS BUILD (native)
----------------------------------------------
TODO - write instructions.  easy way would
be to copy Makefile.mgw and modify it, everything
should be the same except for the compiler name.

----------------------------------------------
MAC OSX (10.3 [and others??])
----------------------------------------------

to compile:
 ./configure 
 make

to run:
 src/ninjas

----------------------------------------------
SUBVERSION (CVS) Notes
----------------------------------------------
[is there a better way than this?]

If you want to include the subversion revision number
in the actual game executable, there is a script which
can extract it and write it out into "auto-config.h"

THIS IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR BETA TESTING USE
This way, we can identify which subversion tree is causing
the problems that beta testers tell us about

do the following: (only works in linux for now):
 1) commit any changes ('svn commit -m "comments about change"')
 2) 'svn up' to update your working copy to the correct revision number
 3) './regen-cvs-tags' to rewrite auto-config.h
 4) build normally

The revision number is output to the console on game startup and is also
the title of the window.

--------------------------------------------------------
TO BUILD THE DOCUMENTATION
--------------------------------------------------------
I use doxygen to generate API info from the source.

To build these docs type 'make doc' from the src/ dir.

The results will be put in docs/html/
That dir is NOT included in the subversion tree.

------------------------------------
NEW CROSS COMPILE (up to date sorta)
MORE DOCS LATER, FOR NOW TRY THIS
------------------------------------

you have to cross compile allegro first.

read and edit cross-configure.sh


OLD STUPID INSTRUCTIONS:

./configure --target=i586-mingw32msvc --host=i586-mingw32msvc --build=linux-i386 --with-extra-includes=/home/dcerquet/i586/include --with-extra-libs=/home/dcerquet/lib/i586-mingw32msvc/
