//! Input Base Class
 
//! The only reason for having a base class is
//! to make derived classes - one which can do 
//! real input live from keyboard, mouse, or joystick
//! and the other class to be able to record the input
//! and play it back for the sake of a demo game.
//!
//! The underlying game should not notice the difference
//! between live and recorded stuff.

//! Common input subsystem

//! The base input class is used for 3 classes:
//! The LiveInput class, the RecordInput class, and
//! PlaybackInput class.
//! -
//! Every frame, Update() MUST be called.  This freezes the
//! current state of the buttons/mouse for this frame.  This is
//! extremely important, especially for the demos, because it makes 
//! sure that input values do NOT change DURING Update()'s.  
//! -
//! If the derived class is LiveInput then input received live
//! from the input devices will be used
//! -
//! If the derived class is RecordInput, it will save the state of
//! the input devices at EVERY frame on Update() to a file.
//! -
//! If the derived class is PlaybackInput, it will load the state
//! of the keys from a file each frame on Update().
//! -
//! The class also saves random seed during recording to make playback
//! be deterministic
