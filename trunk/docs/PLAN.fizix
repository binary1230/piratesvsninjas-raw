Impulse/Momentum

Object with constant velocity/no force/accel needs to stop when it
hits a wall.

What do you do?

Is this right?

Collions(Wall, Object)
The wall applies an Impusle Force on the object.  The impulse force
must be enough to immediately cancel out the velocity of the object (so
it doesn't move against the wall).
