The game assets folder

Here's what each of the directories are for:

dist/
  Things that go in dist/ are what get show in data/ in the final
	game redistributable.

	In other words, If you want something included in the game's data
	that goes to the user, you need to put it in dist/

src/
  This folder is for 'source' graphics, e.g. PSD, XCF, PSPimage, etc
	This stuff does NOT go out to the user

At the moment there isn't a lot of extra structure to the assets folder
